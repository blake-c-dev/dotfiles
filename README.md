# Run Script

A basic script to help manage my Zed IDE config files. Backs up or restores settings/keymap files.

## What it does

- `./run.sh --copy`: Backs up Zed config files to repo (default)
- `./run.sh --load`: Restores Zed config files from repo

That's it. Just a simple script to not lose my IDE settings.
